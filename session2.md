# Session 2: Sound Part Two

## Recap
 - We learned about basic periodic signals
 - We learned how to add them together to create amplitude modulation
 - We learned how to combine periodic signals to create frequency modulation
 - We tried to use basic waveforms to create a range of sounds that continually changed
 - We got a taste of the approach we need to do these things in JavaScript
 - We used variables and basic functions. We also used basic operators (+, -, *, /)
 - Some of you might have come across some additional math objects (abs, exp, sin, cos). 

## First
 - We're going to review the work that you will all have done in the last week
 - Then we're going to have a question and answer session about the example code you were given just to go over the basics.

## Then:
 - We're going to explore how to load samples and manipulate them
 - We're also going to learn how to use the maxiClock object to schedule events. 
 - We will be using conditionals (if statements) to set the state of the program.
 - As a result, we should become clearer about the use of <,>,||,==,&&, and !.
 - We'll also be getting more familiar with using % (modulo)
 
 ## Example code for this session:
  - This basic drum machine example has everything you need in it

  - Here is a more developed example with the play-button code in it, and a more complex output:

# Exercise for this week
 - Create a soundscape or rhythmic piece that uses at least four sounds, and continually changes for over 2 minutes. 

# Additional Materials
 - Here's an advanced example that combines all the things we looked at in the last two weeks, as well as some other stuff
