# Session 5: 3D graphics from scratch

## Recap
 - Last session we looked at more advanced 2D graphics concepts
 - We used expressions to create complex pixel manipulations
 - We also learned about how to basic image processing
 - We looked at concepts such as convolution for edge detection, bluring, and other effects
 - We also thought about complex space a little, and looked at the mandelbrot set a bit

## This session
 - Let's have a look at the work you have done in the last week. 
 - Do you have any questions about the task? What problems did you have?

## 3D graphics slides can be found below
 - These have details of all the work required with this weeks session
 - They include example code, and full explanations of core 3D graphics concepts, including an introduction to matrix transformations.

## HOMEWORK
 - Start from the basic 3D perspective projection that we used.
 - Create an interactive geometry system using this basic engine.
 - Think about how you can adapt some of the knowledge you have learned in previous sessions
 - Also, consider how you might use distance as a factor.
